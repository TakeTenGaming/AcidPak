# Change Log
All notable changes to the modpack will be documented here as best as possible.

*Note:* Some mods under work in progress versions may include multiple version changes. This is to ensure I know what version to fall back to in the event something is broken/bugged or a mods version gets removed.

## Version 1.0.0 - The Gold Release

## Version 0.0.2 - Work In Progress
This changelog is quite extensive as this update spans two entire months. Hopefully the next versions will be more frequent and less filled with ridiculously long changelogs. :P

### Note
- *Lycanite's Mobs* is currently disabled due to many casting bugs/crashes that Lycanite is aware of and is working to fix. The pack will be updated to reenable the mod once a fix is out.
- *Placemod* will not currently generate structures as none have been included. This is intentional as I'd like to make a few of my own as well as customize the ones that generate, and possibly include fan-made submissions. See [Issue #7](https://github.com/xlxAciDxlx/AcidPak2/issues/7) for more information!
