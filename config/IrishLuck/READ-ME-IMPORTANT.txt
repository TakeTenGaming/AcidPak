The files on the Reference folder are just for references on the names that should be used on the config files.
You can also find the ID (Number) you should use for the enchantments when adding enchanted items/blocks.

On the config files it's very important to make sure you don't leave an empty line at the end

Also, respect the Caps on names of the Entities and respect the spaces, the : and / of the provided examples.

Please any question about the configs Tweet to @MrAmericanMike
